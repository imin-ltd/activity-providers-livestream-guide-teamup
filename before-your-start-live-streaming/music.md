# üé∂ Music

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Relevant licence

{% hint style="danger" %}
Are you playing music during the class? You need to ensure you have the relevant licence to do so, as you would in your class run from a studio or other physical location.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
EMD UK has compiled some very helpful information on [permissible music purchases without the need for sync licenses](https://emduk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EMD-UK-LICENCE-FREE-MUSIC-PROVIDERS.pdf).

EMD UK has also created a [Coronavirus FAQs for instructors](https://emduk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Coronavirus-FAQs-for-instructors-03042020.pdf), which includes information about using music during your live streamed virtual classes.
{% endhint %}

### üéô Un-muted participants

When noise is picked up from microphones other than yours, it will interfere with the sound clarity coming from your broadcast. This means that if some participants are left un-muted, others will find it difficult to hear the music you're playing. Consider muting all participants during the class and explaining why you're doing so.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Avoid trying to "sync" music

By getting participants to press play on the same track as you at the same time will inevitably cause a lag between you and them receiving the live stream. Even a few \(milli\)seconds lag in the music can create a bad experience for participants.
