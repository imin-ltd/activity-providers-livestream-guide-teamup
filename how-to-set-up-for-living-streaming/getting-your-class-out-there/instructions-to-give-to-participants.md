# Instructions to give to Participants

If you're using a class management or booking system to manage your live streamed classes and increase their visibility, you'll want to make sure you include a good description of the class \(what to expect etc\), as well as clear instructions about how to access the class.

### ✏️ What you need to include

* Tell them what platform you're using to live stream \(Zoom, Facebook Live etc\) 
* Tell them how they're going to access the access \(you'll send them a link via email 10 minutes before the class, they'll get the live stream link in their confirmation email etc\).  
* Tell them how to be ready for the class \(e.g. download the Zoom app in advance, make sure you can log in to your Facebook account etc\). This could also include making sure they have a fully charged phone / laptop, have a safe space to workout, what equipment they'll need. 
* Tell them what expectations there are on them \(e.g. if you expect everyone to keep their own cameras on, or if you don't mind etc\). 
* Tell them if you'll be available before or after the class, to answer questions or just for a chat \(it's important at times like this to make real connections!\). Or make it clear if you don't want participants to join before the start time of the class, if you've got back to back classes using the same live stream!
