# ü§î Other things to consider

A collection of other things that you might want to consider when setting up live stream classes

#### **Think carefully about the Meeting settings** 

You can set it up so that attendees microphones are muted as they enter the class, and that you're always the main speaker \(i.e. otherwise Zoom will jump to participants' cameras if they make a noise\). This is a good idea in general, but especially if people are joining late and might disturb the class whilst they figure out their muting settings. ü§ê

#### Safety & Insurance

Do you need / have adequate insurance, or do you need participants to agree to confirm they are participating at their own risk?

In general, you should always be making sure your class can be done safely by someone at home. Do you need to modify the format to cater for those at home with less space / no equipment / without you there to guide them?

#### Music

Are you playing music during the class? You need to ensure you have the relevant licence to do so, as you would in your class run from a studio or other physical location.

Also, if participants are left un-muted, people will find it difficult to hear the music you're playing \(because when noise is picked up from microphones other than yours, it will interfere with the sound clarity coming from your broadcast\). 

Avoid trying to "sync" music by getting participants to press play on the same track at the same time - there's inevitably a lag between you and them receiving the live stream, and even a few \(milli\)seconds lag in the music can create a bad experience for participants.

EMD UK \(the national governing body for Exercise, Movement and Dance\) has [provided this advice and fact sheet](https://emduk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-FAQs-for-instructors-24032020.pdf) for instructors which answers a lot of specific questions to do with Insurance, Music and other regulatory aspects during delivery of live streamed classes\).
