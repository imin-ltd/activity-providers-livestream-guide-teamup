  are still with you and in the class.

# üó£ Keep on talking

### üì£ Stay vocal

You might be the vocal type. You might opt for a more relaxed approach to leading a class. During a live stream class, remember to always let people know you'll still there and with them. It helps to be as vocal as possible. Try to keep talking - reassure the people that you are still there. This can be hugely beneficial for participants with sensory impairments, for whom you will need to maximise the quality of your verbal communication.

### üßê Survey your class

Stand back and watch people‚Äôs form - don‚Äôt continually be working. If you stop and observe, people will appreciate this - this is probably why they joined the class. You could start people off on an exercise and then offer feedback \(individual or group\) by looking at people's videos. Give them feedback on their effort levels or form, which will reinforce the idea of community.

### ‚ûï Be positive

Focus on positivity: ‚ÄúGreat squat! Good form!‚Äù You want to provide positive feedback and helpful encouragement without making people feel like they‚Äôre being shouted at for an hour in their own home. Unless that‚Äôs your style, in which case make that known at the start and in your session descriptions.

### ü•≥ Celebrate together

This is no different to an in-person class. People have had to make the effort and motivate themselves to be there with you. So, at the end of your class, don‚Äôt forget to get everyone to do a big round of applause. Celebrate the accomplishments of each and every one of them! This can be especially important for disabled people who may feel more isolated or less active during this time - if you have time a little chat at the end to give feedback, etc. you can help people feel more included \(see [Activity Alliance's website](http://www.activityalliance.org.uk/get-active/at-home/adapting-activities) for more information on adapting activities so more people can stay in and work out\).
