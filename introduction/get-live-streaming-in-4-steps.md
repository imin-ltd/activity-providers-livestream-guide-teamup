## 🏇 The Quick Guide to Live Streaming

1. [**Choose a live streaming platform**](../how-to-set-up-for-live-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/)**.** If you want to run an interactive session, [set up with Zoom](../how-to-set-up-for-live-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-zoom.md). Otherwise you can use [Facebook Live](../how-to-set-up-for-live-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-facebook-live.md), [Instagram Live](../how-to-set-up-for-live-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-instagram-live.md) or [YouTube Live](../how-to-set-up-for-live-streaming/your-tech-set-up/choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-youtube-live.md). 
2. [**Add your live stream session into a class management system or booking system that is OpenActive enabled**.](../how-to-set-up-for-live-streaming/getting-your-class-out-there/increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md) This will allow your class to be published, for free, across many, many platforms that will promote your class to their millions of users. 
3. Check you have adequate insurance cover to teach online, as well as the correct music licencing if you use music. It is advised you contact your insurance provider to check if you are covered to deliver online classes. EMD UK has a very helpful [set of FAQs](https://emduk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Coronavirus-FAQs-for-instructors-03042020.pdf) to help with this. 
4. **Run an awesome session** like only you know how! **💪**
