# üö® Zoom - do's and don'ts

## üèÖ **Hosting tips from** [**Zoom**](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/03/04/best-practices-for-hosting-a-digital-event/?_ga=2.70324371.2055348868.1586158002-1988835527.1586158002)

* **Test the audio before your class begins:** this will ensure your speakers and mic are working properly before the live class begins. [Here‚Äôs how to test your device audio.](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362283-How-Do-I-Join-or-Test-My-Computer-Device-Audio-?zcid=1231)
* **Minimise background noise:** try to host your class in a quiet place. If you must be in a loud environment, using a headset with a mic often reduces background noise compared with your computer‚Äôs built-in microphone.
* **Start on time:** Zoom recommends you start your event 5 minutes early to allow your participants to join before the class kicks off. Be sure to let participants know when the event will begin and if the content will be recorded and shared afterward.

## üéñ Need-to-knows from [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/security-tips-every-work-from-homer-needs-to-know-about-zoom-right-now/)

* **Make sure meetings are password protected:** this is the best way to ensure classes can only be accessed by the intended participants. It may not be practical to password protect every class, but you should use this measure as often as possible.
* **Lock a meeting, when possible, once it's underway:** This will prevent unauthorised participants from joining late. Locking a meeting can be accomplished by clicking "Manage Participants" and using the controls that appear on the right of the meeting window. "Manage Participants" also allows you to mute all participants, eject select participants, or stop select participants from appearing by video.
* **"Join Before Host" setting:** by disabling this setting, you can control the meeting from its very start.
