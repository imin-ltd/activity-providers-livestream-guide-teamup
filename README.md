# üë©‚Äçüè´ Live Streaming Physical Activity: A Guide

## ü§ñ We're here to help you get online

Current world conditions are making it hard for instructors, studios and gyms to do what they do best - helping people to live healthy, active lives.

But our sector doesn't go down without a fight! üí™

With gyms, leisure centres and community venues shut, the digital world has opened up a new way to consume exercise. Organisations, big and small, are making their way online by the barrel-full to offer workouts.

The aim of this guide is to help activity providers of all shapes and sizes take their expertise online. Whether that's yoga, bootcamp, pilates, dance fitness or whatever else, you can easily take advantage of this. You may have worked hard to build a loyal following and strong relationships with your members, which is something you should work to protect, and even strengthen.

It doesn't take long to get your classes online, however, there are a few things to think through, which will be covered in the various sections of this guide.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two main types of online workout: **on-demand** \(watch whenever\) and **live stream** \(instructor is live\). **This guide will focus on live streamed exercise classes.**

## üë®‚Äçüíª Who are we?

We are [imin](https://www.imin.co/) and we believe a different way of sharing data in our sector can get people more physically active.

We support a number of local authorities, health bodies, sports bodies and activity providers to tap into the power of open data to reach new audiences and get more people into physical activity.

But mainly, we really want to do all we can to help everyone in this time of need. We wrote this guide for our partners to support their communities \(e.g. local authorities supporting local activity providers to start live streaming their exercise classes\), but realised the research we were doing would be useful for everyone, right now - so we're publishing it for free here for everyone and anyone to use. We've scanned the best how-to's and information we can find on the web, worked with leading industry authorities \(including [EMD UK](https://emduk.org/), the the national governing body for group exercise\), spoken directly to instructors and participants, and produced the most helpful guide we could.

It's not going to be perfect, so please tell us how we can improve it and we'll be happy to do so. If you've got any specific questions, please email us at hello@imin.co - we're always happy to help.
