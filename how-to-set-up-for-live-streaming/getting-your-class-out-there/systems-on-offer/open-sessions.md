## Welcome to Open Sessions

Open Sessions is a platform that enables sport and activity session providers to post their sessions to multiple activity finders \(such as Change4Life, Get Active, and more\). Making it easy to put your activities in front of thousands of potential local customers.

Open Sessions is free to use and you can promote sessions that take place online or at a local venue.

## Who is Open Sessions designed for?

Most of our users are small to medium organisations or independent instructors who don‚Äôt have their own online booking system.

For example, community groups offering tai chi or seated exercise classes in local community centres; local authority run walking for health programmes or independent instructors offering low cost fitness or sports sessions.

## What features sets Open Sessions apart from the competition?

We know that many organisations and individuals can‚Äôt afford a fee for publishing their sessions, and that they might not need complicated functionality to manage their sessions or take payment.

So, Open Sessions is focused on making it easy for you to publish your session details so that they appear on local and national activity finders.

It‚Äôs basically a free and simple way to get started with publishing your activity sessions online.

## What is the sign-up process?

1. Register and tell us about the sessions you run.
2. We publish your sessions on the web‚Äôs biggest activity finders.
3. 1,000s more people can search for and book your sessions.
