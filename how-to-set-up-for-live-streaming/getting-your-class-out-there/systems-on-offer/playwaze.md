There are no catches, no ifâ€™s and no buts. Playwaze is offering a free way for you to promote, manage and provide anyone with easy access to your activities and content while we wait for the current circumstances we are all to begin to subside.

## How does an instructor enable OpenActive within Playwaze?

Itâ€™s a simple tick of a box to display your activities and content on your website, and on all other public activity finders.

Once you are setup and start adding your activities and classes, you simply have two options you can select \(you can use one or both\):

1. I would like this activity to be listed on my activity finder, embedded on my website.
2. I would like this activity to be published and promoted on all public activity finders. 

## **Can an instructor easily add live streaming to** Playwaze**?**

Playwaze doesnâ€™t host your live streams or on demand content directly; thereâ€™s no need to when thereâ€™s lots of great systems out there for that already. When you add your activities and content, all you do is provide us with a link to where you are delivering your activity or hosting your video, and we will send the person who wants to access it straight there \(unless they need to book on or pay\)!

This means you can use any great live streaming tool like Facebook Live, Instragram Live, Zoom or any other, and upload your on demand content to YouTube, Facebook or Vimeo!
