## How does an instructor enable OpenActive within Bookwhen?

Enabling OpenActive is easy, and you can choose specifically which of your classes youâ€™d like to appear in the feed. [Here](http://support.bookwhen.com/en/articles/1283090-sharing-your-activity-data-with-openactive) is a link to our help article.

## **Can an instructor easily add live streaming to** Bookwhen**?**

There are three methods for adding live streaming to your Bookwhen events:

* Zoom integration. This automatically creates a specific [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) meeting link for each of your events and sends this to attendees. The information is secure, so only booked attendees can access.
* Jitsi integration. This automatically creates a specific [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) meeting link for each of your events and sends this to attendees. The information is secure, so only booked attendees can access.
* Add specific joining link to any event. If you donâ€™t want to use an integration, or youâ€™re using a different platform to Zoom or Jitsi, you can manually add a joining link to individual events in your schedule. Bookwhen will automatically send the information to attendees. Again, this information is secure, so only booked attendees can access.
