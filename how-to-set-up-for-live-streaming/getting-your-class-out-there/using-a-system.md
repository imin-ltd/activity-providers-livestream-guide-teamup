  So, you've decided that it makes sense for you to use a class
  management/booking system. Now just make sure it is "OpenActive enabled"!

# ðŸŽ¨ Your system and OpenActive

## âœ… You already use a class management or booking system...

Excellent! In order to reap the full rewards and [increase the visibility of your classes](increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md), you need to check if your chosen system is "OpenActive enabled":

* **If your system is OpenActive enabled**, great! You're in the perfect position to advertise your virtual classes far and wide! 
* **If your system is** _**not**_ **OpenActive enabled**, then you can either: 
  * Use one of the [systems on offer](systems-on-offer/) _in addition_ to your current system \(although this is not recommended as maintaining information in both places doubles your effort\); or 
  * Replace your existing system and use one of the OpenActive enabled [systems on offer](systems-on-offer/) as your new class management/booking system. 
* **If you are not sure if your existing system is OpenActive enabled** _**or**_ **if it is not on the list of** [**systems on offer**](systems-on-offer/), we highly recommend that you ask them to do the necessary work to become OpenActive enabled. It should not take them long. Alternatively, please do email hello@openactive.io with information about your system so the team at OpenActive can help make this a reality.

## ðŸ’­ You don't use a class management or booking system _yet_, but want to...

Don't panic! That's an excellent position to be in.

There are class management/booking systems of all shapes and sizes out there for you to choose from. The following section lists some of the [systems on offer](systems-on-offer/) that you can choose from. Pick one and you're off!
