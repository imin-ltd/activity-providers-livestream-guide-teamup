# ⚙️ Using a system to manage your classes

### 👩‍🏫 Is a class management or booking system right for you?

{% hint style="success" %}
Having a class management/booking system is a great idea if:

* you are managing quite a few classes;
* you want to build a relationship with your participants; and/or
* you want to take bookings and payments.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
You may **not** need a class management/booking system if:

* you don't need to take bookings or payments;
* you don't need help managing multiple classes; or
* you just want to get on with live streaming your classes direct to your audience on Facebook or Instagram.

However, without a system, you’ll miss out on an opportunity to [increase the visibility of your classes](increasing-the-visibility-of-your-live-streamed-classes.md).
