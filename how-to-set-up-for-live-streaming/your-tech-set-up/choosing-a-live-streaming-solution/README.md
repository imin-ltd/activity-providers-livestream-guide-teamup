# üìΩ Choosing a live streaming solution

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Check your existing booking system

First things first - your existing booking system might already have an easy way for you to deliver live streamed exercise - many now have pre-built integrations with live streaming platforms. If this is the case, that's probably the best \(and quickest\) way for you to get your classes online, so check with your booking system first.

If you don't use a booking system, then it might be worth quickly checking out this section to see if it makes sense for you to start using one:

## üé¨ Select a live stream solution that works for you

There are a few options to choose from and it‚Äôs important to make sure you are comfortable with whichever solution you use. The happier and more relaxed you are, the more this will reassure your online participants.

Here's an overview of the main options, with further detail available in this section. Each option is fairly simple to set up and use, so take a look and pick the one that works best for you.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Zoom" %}
**Best for:**

* Large or small interactive classes, where you want to see and hear from participants.
* Paid-for classes \(you can generate unique URLs per class to send to participants\).

**Good to know:**

* There is a free option \(limited to 40 mins per broadcast without a recording option\). The paid for plan starts at ¬£11.99.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Facebook Live" %}
**Best for:**

* Connecting with your existing followers and other potential participants on Facebook.
* Extremely simple to get going.

**Good to know:**

* You can't see or hear your participants, so if your classes usually involve feedback, adjustments, etc. then Facebook Live isn't ideal for you.
* You can receive Facebook messages and reactions, but this may distract you during the class.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Instagram Live" %}
**Best for:**

* Connecting with your existing followers and other potential participants on Instagram.
* Extremely simple to get going.

**Good to know:**

* Like with Facebook Live, you can't see or hear your participants, so not ideal if you prefer delivering interactive classes. Also, all Instagram broadcasts are in portrait, so bear this in mind!
* Also, unlike with Facebook Live, Instagram Live videos disappear from your profile after 24 hours, so participants can't watch them easily later.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="YouTube Live" %}
**Best for:**

* Can be publicly or privately shared, so potentially suitable for both free and paid-for classes.

**Good to know:**

* To broadcast from a mobile, you'll need to have at least 1,000 subscribers, but you can stream from a webcam without restrictions. You might also have to wait a little while \(24 hours\) when you first try to broadcast for your account to be verified by YouTube.
