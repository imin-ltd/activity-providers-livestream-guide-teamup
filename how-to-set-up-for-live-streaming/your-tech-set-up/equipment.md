# ü§≥üèª Equipment

### üìù What you will need \(at a minimum\)

* [ ] A smart device \(e.g. your phone, tablet, etc.\) or laptop with a camera and Wi-Fi connection \(we recommend a laptop as you will be able to see the participants more easily for interactive sessions\); 
* [ ] Access to power \(you probably want the device plugged into the charger to avoid catastrophic low power situations!\); 
* [ ] A decent internet connection \(a download speed of no less than 1.5 Mbps is recommended, but the faster the better!\); 
* [ ] A place to setup your device \(ideally a tripod or stand, but not essential - a chair or stack of books might do the trick if stable\); 
* [ ] A hazard-free area in which to work out; and 
* [ ] Your normal workout equipment to deliver the class.

### ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You'll need to play around to get things perfect for you

Other things to consider are:

* **Camera:** can you see the participants clearly? Will they be able to see \(all of\) you? Is your the device at a good height and suitable distance from you? Have you tested at different times of the day \(e.g. does the sun cause a glare in the morning in a certain position\)? Is your background clear of clutter to avoid distracting your participants? 
* **Improving standard equipment:** you might want to supplement your laptop/smart device with a separate HD webcam, microphone and/or studio lights to create the best experience for participants. 
* **Audio:** can they hear you? Can you hear them? If there's music, can they hear that well? Is it better for you to wear wireless headphones so your voice is clear? 
* **Multiple Devices:** especially for interactive sessions using Zoom, some instructors prefer to set up two devices - one close to them, so they can see participants \(e.g. their laptops or tablets - bigger screen\), and one device setup further away to be the main camera for broadcasting the live stream \(e.g. the main camera on your phone - not the selfie camera as it is less high quality than the rear-facing camera!\). Both devices are plugged into the same live stream session by simply using the same "meeting" URL \(see the [Using Zoom](choosing-a-live-streaming-solution/using-zoom.md) section for more details\). This avoids you having to go back and forth to the main camera to check if Keith is doing his downward dog properly. This way, you can see Keith on the device nearest to you with a quick glance, without disrupting the class to walk over to where the camera is. No excuses, Keith!

### üë©‚Äçüî¨ Test, test and....TEST

You'll see this repeated a few times in this guide \(because it's an important point!\):

**It's well worth testing your set up with friends or relatives first to ensure everything works as you expect it \(especially the internet connection!\).**
{% endhint %}

### üì≤ What else will I need?

You'll also need to choose a platform to live stream your classes - there are a number on offer, so we've reviewed the main ones for you to consider in the next section:

If you want to take online bookings or payments for your live stream classes and you don't already use a booking system, then you might want to set one up. There are also ways to help get further visibility for your live streamed classes. Check out our guide here:

{% page-ref page="../getting-your-class-out-there/" %}

You will also need insurance to cover you for the classes you will be delivering:

You will need to check that you have the requisite licences when playing music during your live streamed classes:
